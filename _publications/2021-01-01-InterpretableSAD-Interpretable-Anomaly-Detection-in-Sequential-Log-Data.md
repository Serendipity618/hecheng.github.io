abstract: 'Anomaly detection in sequential log data is a common data analysis task as it contributes to detecting critical information, such as malfunctions of systems. However, due to the scarcity of anomalies, the traditional supervised learning approaches cannot be applied for anomaly detection tasks. Meanwhile, most of the existing studies only focus on identifying the anomalous log sequences and cannot further detect the anomalous events in a sequence. In this work, we present InterpretableSAD, an interpretable log anomaly detection framework that can achieve both anomalous sequence and fine-grained event detection. Given a set of normal log sequences, we propose a data augmentation strategy to generate a set of anomalous sequences via negative sampling so that we can train a binary classification model based on the observed normal sequences and the generated anomalous sequences. After training, the classification model is able to detect real anomalous log sequences. We then consider the anomalous event detection as a model interpretation problem and apply an interpretable machine learning technique in a novel way to detect which parts of the sequences, a.k.a, anomalous events, lead to anomalous issues. Experimental results on three log datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed framework.'
